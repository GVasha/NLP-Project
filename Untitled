Foreigner's Identity Number (NIE)
Foreigners who, due to their economic, professional, social, or other interests, have ties to Spain, will be assigned a personal, unique, and sequential identification number.

This personal number will be the foreigner's identifier and must appear on all documents issued or processed for them, as well as on any entries in their identity card or passport.

This number will be assigned at the request of the interested party, provided the following requirements are met:

They are not in Spain in an irregular situation.
They state the reasons for requesting the assignment of this number.

For the assignment of an NIE based on economic, professional, social, or other interests, the following applications will be accepted:

Those submitted in Spain in person by the interested party, through the Immigration Offices or Police Stations.

Applications submitted in Spain through a duly authorized legal representative must be submitted via the Immigration Offices or Police Stations.

Applications submitted outside of Spain must be submitted through the Spanish Consular Offices located in the applicant's country of residence, within their corresponding consular district.

To obtain the required number, the following documents must be submitted:

A completed and signed standard application form.
Original and copy of the applicant's passport, identity document, travel document, or valid registration certificate.
Statement of the economic, professional, social, or other reasons justifying the application.

When applying through a representative, the representative must provide proof of sufficient power of attorney expressly authorizing them to submit the application.
